          "The freeCodeCamp community was an early adopter of Discourse, a powerful forum tool designed by Stack Overflow founder Jeff Atwood.

One benefit of a forum is that other people can then discover past conversations, and use them to help get unstuck. If you ask a question on the freeCodeCamp forum, you will generally get an answer in just a few hours.",
