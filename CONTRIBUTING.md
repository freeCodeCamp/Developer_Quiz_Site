## Guidelines for adding quiz questions

We are looking to add more quiz questions for the following categories:

- Linux
- SQL
- Computer Science
- Quality Assurance
- Agile
- Security

The quiz question categories can be found in the `data` folder.
https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/Developer_Quiz_Site/tree/main/src/data

Before you add any quiz questions, please check to make sure that it does not already exist in the file.

All questions follow this format:

```
  {
    Question: "Which one of these data structures follows the FIFO (First In First Out) method?",
    Answer: "Queue",
    Distractor1: "Stack",
    Distractor2: "Array",
    Distractor3: "Linked List",
    Explanation: "A queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) method as the element which gets inserted first gets removed first.",
    Link: "https://youtu.be/B31LgI4Y4DQ?t=16410",
  },
```

For the `Explanation` field, please keep your explanations to a couple of sentences. For the `link` field, please make sure to use a freeCodeCamp article, freeCodeCamp YouTube video or official documentation.
If you choose to reference a video, please make sure to include the timestamp for the topic covered.

You can read more about how to create timestamps in this [helpful article](https://www.lifewire.com/link-to-specific-part-of-youtube-video-1616414).

**PLEASE NOTE: Any PR's that have questions taken from other quiz sites will not accepted. Please come up with your own quiz questions.**

### Quiz questions with code samples

Please refrain from creating quiz questions that have code samples. The reason for this is that we have found that these types of questions don't end up displaying well in the current layout and they are sometimes hard to read.

## Issues available for contribution

### Open to multiple contributors label

Any open issue that is marked with the `open to multiple contributors` label is free for anyone to work on and will not be assigned to just one person.

### Available for assignment label

Any open issue that is marked with the `Available for assignment` label will open for the first person that replies back to the issue asking to be assigned. Once that person has been assigned then they are free to start work on the issue.

### Already Assigned label

Open issues that have the `already assigned` label are not available for pickup. If someone has been assigned to this issue and there has been no movement on it for weeks, then the maintainers will reach out to the individual to ask if they are still interested in working on it. If the individual has decided not to pursue the issue anymore, then the maintainers will open it back up for contribution and remove the `already assigned` label.

**NOTE: Only the person assigned to the issue is free to create a PR. Other contributors that create a PR for an already assigned issue will have their PR closed.**
