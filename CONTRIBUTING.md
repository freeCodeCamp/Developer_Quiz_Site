## Guidelines for adding quiz questions

We are looking to add more quiz questions for the following categories:

- JavaScript
- Python
- Linux
- SQL
- Computer Science
- Quality Assurance
- Agile
- Security

All of the quiz questions can be added to this [quiz file](./src/data/full-quiz.ts). Before you add any quiz questions, please check to make sure that it does not already exist in the file. If your quiz question does not exist, then add it to the top of the [quiz file](./src/data/full-quiz.ts).

All questions follow this format:

```
  {
    Question: "Which one of these data structures follows the FIFO (First In First Out) method?",
    Answer: "Queue",
    Distractor1: "Stack",
    Distractor2: "Array",
    Distractor3: "Linked List",
    Explanation: "A queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) method as the element which gets inserted first gets removed first.",
    Link: "https://youtu.be/B31LgI4Y4DQ?t=16410",
  },
```

For the `Explanation` field, please keep your explanations to a couple of sentences. For the `link` field, please make sure to use a freeCodeCamp article, freeCodeCamp YouTube video or official documentation.
If you choose to reference a video, please make sure to include the timestamp for the topic covered.
