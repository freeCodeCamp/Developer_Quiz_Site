## Guidelines for adding quiz questions

We are looking to add more quiz questions for the following categories:

- JavaScript
- Python
- Linux
- SQL
- Computer Science
- Quality Assurance
- Agile
- Security

The quiz question categories can be found in the `data` folder.
https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/Developer_Quiz_Site/tree/main/src/data

Before you add any quiz questions, please check to make sure that it does not already exist in the file.

All questions follow this format:

```
  {
    Question: "Which one of these data structures follows the FIFO (First In First Out) method?",
    Answer: "Queue",
    Distractor1: "Stack",
    Distractor2: "Array",
    Distractor3: "Linked List",
    Explanation: "A queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) method as the element which gets inserted first gets removed first.",
    Link: "https://youtu.be/B31LgI4Y4DQ?t=16410",
  },
```

For the `Explanation` field, please keep your explanations to a couple of sentences. For the `link` field, please make sure to use a freeCodeCamp article, freeCodeCamp YouTube video or official documentation.
If you choose to reference a video, please make sure to include the timestamp for the topic covered.

You can read more about how to create timestamps in this [helpful article](https://www.lifewire.com/link-to-specific-part-of-youtube-video-1616414).
